# HA Climate Deskband

Control a thermostat from you taskbar!

I wanted to have a quicker way to control the thermostat than open the webpage or the app, but have it always available at my fingertips.

## Home Assistant

Home Assistant is a free and open-source home automation software designed to be the central home automation control system for controlling smart home technology.

## My setup

Working from Home since March 2020, and now the winter has arrived, it was getting cold (17Â°C) in the garage to work all day, sitting still. The wall radiator only provides some warmth when the underfloor heater is asking heat. So I needed some extra heating.

I have a smart power plug connected to Home Assistant which has a electric heater on it. Besides that I have the [Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC](https://a.aliexpress.com/_BSEyaG) Hygrometer, read through an [ESP32](https://a.aliexpress.com/_B1IE4Y) with an [antenna](https://a.aliexpress.com/_B1fp7a). The Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC is flashed with [custom firmware](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer) made by ATC1441, thanks @ATC1441! This provides faster/better temperature changes and also shows battery.

# Ideas
